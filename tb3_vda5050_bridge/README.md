# tb3_vda5050_bridge

ROS 2 bridge node that connects `vda5050_client_adapter` to the TurtleBot3 / Nav2 stack. Converts VDA5050 orders into `NavigateToPose` goals and feeds odometry, battery, and traversal events back to the adapter.

## Overview

The bridge is the southbound robot driver for the VDA5050 stack. It receives validated `vda5050_msgs/Order` topics from the client adapter, plans the traversal node-by-node, dispatches Nav2 goals, and emits `node_reached` / `edge_entered` / `edge_completed` events that drive the adapter's `OrderManager`. A stale-callback token prevents old canceled goals from corrupting the current order state.

### State machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> DISPATCHING : order received
    DISPATCHING --> NAVIGATING : Nav2 goal accepted
    DISPATCHING --> WAITING_FOR_RELEASE : next node unreleased
    DISPATCHING --> IDLE : no more work
    NAVIGATING --> DISPATCHING : goal succeeded
    NAVIGATING --> PAUSED : pause request
    NAVIGATING --> FAULTED : goal failed / rejected
    WAITING_FOR_RELEASE --> PAUSED : pause request
    WAITING_FOR_RELEASE --> DISPATCHING : resume / order update
    PAUSED --> DISPATCHING : resume request
    PAUSED --> IDLE : cancel request
    FAULTED --> DISPATCHING : new order
    FAULTED --> IDLE : cancel request
```

| Mode | driving | paused | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IDLE` | false | false | No active work |
| `DISPATCHING` | false | false | Planning or sending next step |
| `NAVIGATING` | true | false | Active Nav2 goal in flight |
| `WAITING_FOR_RELEASE` | false | false | Next node is horizon / unreleased |
| `PAUSED` | false | true | Navigation intentionally paused |
| `FAULTED` | false | false | Nav2 goal failed or unavailable |

## Package Structure

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/bridge_node.cpp` | ROS orchestration: owns all publishers/subscribers and the Nav2 action client. Translates between the ROS interface and the session/state-machine. |
| `src/order_session.cpp` | `plan_next_work()` traversal algorithm: released action-only nodes are consumed immediately; navigable nodes are sent to Nav2; unreleased nodes trigger WAITING_FOR_RELEASE. |
| `include/.../bridge_state_machine.hpp` | Centralizes mode transitions and derives `driving` / `paused` flags. Prevents contradictory states. |
| `config/bridge_params.yaml` | ROS parameters (adapter namespace, topic names, Nav2 action name). |

## Data Flow

**Downlink (adapter → Nav2)**

```
vda5050_client_adapter ~/order
  → BridgeNode → OrderSession::plan_next_work()
  → NavigateToPose::async_send_goal(pose)
  → on success: emit node_reached / edge_completed → plan_next_work()
```

**Uplink (TurtleBot3 → adapter)**

```
/odom → BridgeNode → ~/agv_position · ~/velocity
/battery_state → BridgeNode → ~/battery_state
BridgeStateMachine → ~/driving · ~/paused
```

## Startup & Robustness

The bridge is designed so that **startup order does not matter**:

- **Bridge starts before Nav2** — a navigation goal is not failed if the Nav2 action
  server is not up yet. The order is held and re-attempted on a 2 s timer; the goal goes
  out as soon as Nav2 appears.
- **New order replaces an active one** — the bridge lets Nav2 **preempt** the active goal
  (sends the replacement, bumps the navigation token) instead of cancelling and re-sending
  in the same tick, which on a single-goal server races and can make Nav2 silently drop
  the new goal.
- **Stale callbacks** — each goal carries a monotonic token; results from superseded goals
  are ignored.

See [docs/architecture.md §6, §6b](docs/architecture.md) for details.

Make sure `vda5050_client_adapter` and Nav2 are running before starting the bridge.
